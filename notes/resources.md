Here's what you'd need to gather and process for programming convention datasets to be used by your static analyzer:

**Data Gathering:**

* **Coding Standards Documents:** Collect coding standard documents for the programming languages you want to support. These documents outline the specific conventions expected for that language (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google JavaScript Style Guide). 
* **Open-Source Code Repositories:**  Mine code from well-maintained open-source repositories written in your target languages. Look for repositories with high ratings and active communities to ensure code quality. 
* **Public Code Datasets:** Explore existing public datasets containing labeled code examples. Some resources include Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and CodeClimate's open-source dataset. These datasets might have pre-labeled code snippets with specific coding convention violations.

**Data Processing:**

* **Code Cleaning:** The gathered code might contain irrelevant information for the static analyzer. Remove comments, whitespace, and unnecessary formatting before processing.
* **Code Snippet Extraction:** Extract relevant code snippets that showcase specific violations of coding conventions. This could involve isolating function definitions, variable declarations, or code blocks with formatting inconsistencies. 
* **Labeling:**  Assign labels to the extracted code snippets.  These labels will indicate the specific coding convention violated in each snippet. Leverage the coding standard documents and your understanding of the conventions to accurately label the data. Here are some examples of labels:
    * indentation_error (incorrect indentation)
    * missing_semicolon 
    * variable_naming_convention (violation of naming rules)
    * unused_variable
* **Data Splitting:** Split the processed data into training, validation, and testing sets for the static analyzer. The training set will be used to train the analyzer to identify violations, the validation set will help fine-tune the model during training, and the testing set will evaluate the final performance of the analyzer.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Balancing the Dataset:**  Ensure your dataset is balanced, meaning there's a sufficient number of examples for each type of coding convention violation.  This prevents the analyzer from becoming biased towards more frequent violations.
* **Version Control:** If using code from open-source repositories, consider the version control history. Focus on recent versions to capture the latest coding conventions and avoid outdated practices.
* **Continuous Improvement:**  As you gather more data and user feedback, you can continuously improve your dataset by adding new violations, refining labels, and ensuring the data reflects best practices in the evolving coding landscape.

**Tools and Libraries:**

* **Version control system (VCS):** Git
* **Text processing libraries:** Regular expressions (built-in or libraries like `re` in Python)
* **Data manipulation libraries:** Pandas (Python)
* **Machine learning libraries:** Scikit-learn (Python) can be used for initial data exploration and splitting.

By gathering and processing a well-structured dataset, you can train your static analyzer to effectively identify coding convention violations in your intelligent code reviewing tool. Remember, the quality and comprehensiveness of your data will significantly impact the accuracy and effectiveness of the static analysis component.

Here's how your intelligent code reviewing tool can leverage open-source LLMs to analyze code style issues and provide in-depth recommendations:

**1. Integration with Static Code Analyzer:**

* You'll need an open-source static code analyzer like Pylint (Python) or ESLint (JavaScript) integrated with your tool. This analyzer will scan the code and identify potential style violations based on established coding conventions.

**2. Preprocessing and Tokenization:**

* Once the static analyzer identifies issues, extract the relevant code snippets and surrounding context (e.g., function definitions, variable declarations).
* Preprocess the extracted code by removing irrelevant information like comments and whitespace. This ensures the LLM focuses on the essential code structure.
* Tokenize the preprocessed code, breaking it down into smaller units like keywords, identifiers, and operators. This format aligns better with how LLMs process text data.

**3. Leveraging Open-Source LLMs:**

* Choose an open-source LLM like CodeT5 or Bard specifically trained on code. These models can understand the code structure and semantics better than general-purpose LLMs.
* Formulate queries for the LLM based on the identified style violations. The queries should include the extracted code snippet, the specific coding convention violated, and context about the surrounding code.

**4. Generating In-depth Recommendations:**

* The LLM will analyze the query and leverage its knowledge of coding conventions to suggest appropriate solutions. This might involve:
    * Suggesting alternative code structures that adhere to the convention.
    * Providing explanations for the recommended approach, including the benefits of following the convention.
    * Offering code examples or references to relevant documentation that further explain the convention.

**Resources Needed:**

* **Open-source static code analyzer:** Pylint (Python), ESLint (JavaScript), CodeClimate (various languages)
* **Open-source LLM for code:** CodeT5, Bard 
* **Libraries for code preprocessing and tokenization:** NLTK (Python)
* **Cloud platforms for LLM access:** Google AI Platform, Hugging Face  Transformers Hub
* **Software development expertise:**  to integrate the components, handle data flow, and build the user interface.
* **Machine learning expertise:** to fine-tune the LLM prompts and interpret the generated responses effectively.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Fine-tuning the LLM:** Consider fine-tuning the chosen LLM on a dataset of code snippets with specific coding convention violations and their corresponding best practices. This can improve the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations provided.
* **Confidence Scores:**  The LLM might generate multiple suggestions. Implement a mechanism to assign confidence scores to each suggestion, indicating the LLM's certainty in its recommendation.
* **User Interface Design:**  Develop a user interface that clearly displays the code snippet, the identified violation, and the LLM's recommendations with explanations. This will enhance the learning experience for beginner programmers.

By combining static code analysis and the power of open-source LLMs, your intelligent code reviewing tool can offer valuable insights and guidance, assisting beginner programmers in writing clean, maintainable, and well-formatted code.
