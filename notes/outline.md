# Chapter 1 outline
## Background information

#### 1st Paragraph:

> Brief Overview - Introduction to the core area, domain of the project. For this project, the core area of focus is Programming Conventions in software development. 

Outline:
- Talk on the importance or relevance of programming conventions in software development, using the history or evolution of these coding standards.


#### 2nd Paragraph:

> Brief Overview - The problems in this space, lack of programming conventions studies. 

Outline:

- Talk on the importance of beginner programmers to learn programming conventions while in their interim stages of learning software development. Programming conventions are usually overlooked at this stage. Talk about disadvantages of neglecting these standards during this learning stage.


#### 3rd Paragraph:

> Brief Overview - The solution to the problem identified. Intelligent Code Reviewing tool as a learning resource for coding standards.

Outline:

- Talk about a code reviewing tool, also talk on how code reviewing tools have solved problems in other domains. 


#### 4th Paragraph:

> Brief Overview - Other solutions/works in this domain, and their limitations. 

Outline:

- Talk about other works and their limitations, and how the code reviewing tool potentially solves the limitations from those works by offering real-time feedback on proper formatting, naming conventions, and code organization.


#### 5th Paragraph

> Brief Overview - The promise that your proposed approach will deliver. Hypothesis Statement

Outline:

- Talk about the promise of the code reviewing tool.

## Statement of the Problem

### 1st Paragraph/Theme: 

Theme: 

> The overarching problem in the Domain

Outline: 

1. Talk on the problem: Beginner programmers skipping programming conventions, underepresentation of code styles in programming courses / education, use the findings from ITiCSE working group. Talk on the adverse problems poor code quality has on the software development industry.
2. Talk on the limitation of existing code review solutions, add the solution to these limitations: including programming conventions as a core feature to check for, real time feedback. Code review as a learning resource.


## Limitations of the Study

Some limitations:

1. The tool would only be able to review one language, limiting it to a niche of programmers/ programmers using that language.
2. The effectiveness of the LLM Component (The explanation module) in generating explanations and justificaitons relies heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of the training data. This can lead to biased or inaccurate responses.
3. The initial version of the tool might only address a soecific set of coding conventions.
